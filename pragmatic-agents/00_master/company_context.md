# Hologram – Company Context (Draft)

## What we do
Hologram is a virtual AI compute acceleration layer (virtual GPU / virtual AI OS).
It optimizes AI workloads on existing hardware (CPU/GPU) to increase throughput
and reduce energy and infrastructure cost.

## Who we serve (initially)
- CTO / VP Engineering / Head of AI at AI-native startups
- AI platform teams inside larger enterprises
- Research labs needing cheaper/faster inference/training

## Why it matters
- AI infra costs and GPU constraints block scale
- Hologram provides 3x throughput at ~1/3 energy (target)
- Works with existing frameworks (PyTorch, CUDA, etc.) with minimal code changes
